<p>Powered by energy efficient AC motors, the BT Reflex R-series and E-series of reach trucks are best suited to forklift applications involving high lifting with heavy loads. The latest family of low level order picking trucks from Toyota Material Handling is the BT Optio L-series. We're here to let you know what sets lifted trucks apart from other pickups on the road - it's more than just the style and the ride height.</p>
<p>Orderpickers will be used in applications where pallet trucks, rolling ladders, and other piece-picking methods are traditionally used. Variable-reach (or telehandler) forklifts are used to lift pallets or other objects to heights using a telescoping arm. Call us today on 1300 423 675 or email for a quote on one of our quality used rough terrain forklifts for your Australian worksite.</p>
<p>Due to ineffective (or nonexistent) training, many forklift drivers aren't aware of max load capacities, or how to safely navigate their workspace with a heavy load. Our friendly and knowledgable forklift sales staff will do a full site assessment to identify the best new forklift for you. Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>

<p>This means there is approximately a 35% reduction in the turning circle of the forklift, making the reach forklift far more maneuverable than the standard counterbalance forklift. AUSA forklifts outstand for their productivity and safety in all types of load handling on difficult and irregular ground. We offer competitive prices for all of our rental services, and several different tool rental rate options for your convenience.</p>
<p>These types of powered industrial trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and have pneumatic (air filled) tires. Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
