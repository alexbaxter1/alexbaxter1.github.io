<p>It is about as close to a full size forklift as pallet jacks get. The rough terrain forklift is an ideal piece of material handling equipment for outdoor construction and loading activities. A brief discussion of the various types of forklifts on the market can help you to understand why answering the above questions first is essential to ensure you get the right equipment for the job.</p>

Can be used indoors and outdoors for loads 2,000lbs+.</p>
<h2>Fork Truck Hire Sterling Heights</h2>
<p>High-level order pickers enable an operator to pick cases or items from 20 feet to 35 feet. The best way to prevent rough terrain forklift-related injury, accidents or death is by getting educated, licensed and certified in Rough Terrain Forklift Training.
