<p>Leveling kits do just that-level the stance of a Jeep or truck from front to rear. Achieving nearly 10% growth, Hangcha Group sold 82,350 units across all forklift classes, an increase of more than 23%, and good enough to climb from No. 12 in 2015 to No. 9. The company was published on the Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange at the end of 2016. Diesel: Diesel forklifts can lift much bigger loads and move faster.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
