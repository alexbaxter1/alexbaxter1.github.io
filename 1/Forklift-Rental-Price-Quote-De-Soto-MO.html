It is common for indoor electric forklifts to use cushion tires. Rough terrain forklifts are essential material handling equipment on many worksites. A different type of forklift is to be used. Other key features include an intuitive multi-function control handle, patented open view mast, low step height, ductile iron baselegs and an exclusive suspension system for superior load stability.</p>

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
