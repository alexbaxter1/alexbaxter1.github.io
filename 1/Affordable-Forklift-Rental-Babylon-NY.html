These advanced electric forklifts are equipped with the newest generation of AC technology, assuring you industry-leading performance. Since order pickers drive an order picker lifts (industrial powered trucks), they have to complete order picker training and obtain an order pick license to work in the United States.</p>

Linde offers many additional options for all pallet trucks. The AM 22 hand pallet truck is also available in low-noise form. Counterbalance forklifts are very versatile and are available in three or four wheeled models, have two forks protruding from the front of the machine, and have a counterbalance weight in the back of the truck to ensure loads don't create an imbalance.</p>

This allows our electric reach trucks to transport loads weighing up to 2.5 tons quickly and safely to their destination.

We carry a huge selection of lift trucks and forklifts for rent to provide a fit no matter the size or scope of your application. Now you've seen how a forklift's center of gravity can shift.
