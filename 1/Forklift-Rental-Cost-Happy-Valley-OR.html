Descriptive, task-oriented names (such as side loader, high-lift pallet” forklift) aside, forklifts are often referred to in more colloquial terms.</p>
<p>The forks on a reach truck are attached to a pantograph mechanism that extends them forward to place in or retrieve pallets from warehouse racking. Order pickers feature an elevating platform that brings the operator to the level of the stock, similar to a cherry picker. The extra-long frame combined with a larger counterweight means this model can handle larger loads.</p>

<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
