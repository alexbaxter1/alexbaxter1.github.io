<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet.

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when the load is raised to maximum lift height.</p>
