<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity. Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets. The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>Pallet jacks can be used to move pallets of new merchandise to the proper section where the merchandise needs to be put on display. Capacity requirements can arise without notice, so a forklift rental can help an operation stay nimble and responsive to changing business conditions.
