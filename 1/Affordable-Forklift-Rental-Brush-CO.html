<p>For off road purposes, lifting a truck is the best way to improve its performance. In terms of volume, the global Pallet Trucks market is estimated to exhibit attractive growth rate over the forecast period. In the past this job was done with either ladders, a dangerous and ineffective solution, or with reach trucks with goods on pallets and blocked aisles. When the operator is done with pallet jack, he or she shouldn't leave the equipment just sitting out anywhere.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres. Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>
