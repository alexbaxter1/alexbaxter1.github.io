<p>Looking to rent material handling equipment in Phoenix? These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. OSHA General Industry Standard 1910.178()(1) Only stable or safely arranged loads shall be handled. Access Hire Australia have a range of rough terrain forklifts for hire to suit your needs including various operating weights, lift capacities and dimensions. One of the most important and widely used pieces of equipment in material handling, the lift truck is a powered industrial vehicle used to lift and transport materials for short distances.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at a few common hazards associated with forklifts. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction. Apart from this, these rental services are rendered according to the client's demands. They work better than 4-wheel forklifts where space is limited. This product range is capable of moving the heavy loads very easily and for the packing goods in warehouses, stores and factories.</p>

<p>Platform slope value of 14 percent applies to trucks with single rear wheel drive (or brake), and 18 percent applies to trucks with dual rear wheel drive (or brakes), respectively. As a result, more manufacturers are focusing on SUV's and trucks So customers are now trying to make their trucks and SUVs look different and unique. At the trucks' heart is advanced AC drive technology, which combines improved torque, efficiency and control with minimal maintenance needs.</p>
<p>The 30 Wastemaster counterbalance forklift with telescopic boom is a proven cost saver. Any attachment on a forklift will reduce its nominal load rating, which is computed with a stock fork carriage and forks.

<p>Whether you're looking to buy a new forklift, rent compact construction equipment, or service an existing machine, everything we do is rooted in the highest quality. But a truck with 31" tires just will not go anywhere unless it is paved and suitable for cars. When driving around in a lifted Jeep Wrangler, you are in control of a highly capable truck.
