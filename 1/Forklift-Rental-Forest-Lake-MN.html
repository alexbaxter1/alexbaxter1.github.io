<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame.

Featuring big, tractor-style tires that provide plenty of traction to handle even the most challenging outdoor terrain, these rugged trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and used outdoors.</p>
<p>For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1, of at full rearward till permitted by the truck mechanism at that elevation, whichever is less stable, Where tilt restrictions for various elevations are employed, and the rearward tilt position is determined to be less stable, the truck should be tested at maximum elevation for each tilt restriction permitted by the truck mechanism.</p>

PA Industrial Equipment has an extensive selection of high quality, dependable, economical used forklifts.

<p>This decreased load center is specified, recognizing that loads may be handled which have a higher density and therefore, shorter load center than the truck rating.
