<p>When comparing between electric and gas-fueled forklift types, the choice comes down to a warehouse's needs. Conversion training - This is for those who have experience with some type of forklift truck but wish to advance into other types.

This involves driving the pallet jack throughout the warehouse, collecting different products on the order sheet, and safely getting out of the warehouse to load the orders onto a truck or other shipping vehicle.</p>
