<p>In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually. Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>We offer Forklifts, Cranes and other Heavy equipments on rental contracts across all industrial sectors like FMCG, Logistics, Warehouse, Manufacturing Industries and many more. KION Group is the other major material handling company in Germany, and they have even stronger sales than Jungheinrich.

Rough terrain poses additional threats and risks to the operators of forklifts. However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want.
