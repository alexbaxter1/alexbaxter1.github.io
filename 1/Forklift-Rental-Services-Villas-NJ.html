Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>
