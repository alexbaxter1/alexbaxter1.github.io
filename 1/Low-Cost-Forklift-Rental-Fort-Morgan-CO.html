<p>With that much juice, the 2C5000 can lift a full payload at 125 ft per minute while an empty payload reaches 130 fpm. The best thing about rough terrain forklifts is that they allow you to work in places traditional forklifts can't go. Rugged terrain that is difficult to excavate, access or navigate doesn't need to slow your work down. Check out our range of used forklifts available for purchase.</p>
