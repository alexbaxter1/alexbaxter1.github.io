<p>Powered industrial trucks, commonly called forklifts or lift trucks, are used in many industries, primarily to move materials. We have a team of sales executives that are responsible for offering product information on our wide range of new Heli forklifts. Hand trucks lift the load a few inches off the ground, so they meant to be carrying things for long distances or extended periods.</p>
<p>Wang says that Hangcha will continue to invest in rough-terrain R&D, particularly in developing equipment with more tonnage and configurations. Rough terrain poses additional threats and risks to the operators of forklifts. However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want. They have been renting out equipment for over 50 years.</p>
