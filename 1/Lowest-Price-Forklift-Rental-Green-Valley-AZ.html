A lift kit gives your truck a lot of added benefits that other trucks don't have.

With breakthrough lift heights, capacities, visibility and energy savings, the Crown family of reach trucks can help you move and store materials efficiently.</p>
<p>The Industrial Truck Association has placed powered industrial trucks into 7 classes.
