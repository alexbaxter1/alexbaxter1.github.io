<h3>Counterbalance Forklift Truck Georgetown TX</h3>
<p>Keep your credit line clear - Unlike financing equipment, long-term rentals have little impact on your ability to borrow money to increase your business. Counterbalance forklift is characterized by its stability with the low center of gravity in its structure. Many manufacturers opt for watertight wheel bearings, a hydraulic elevator or a built-in pump to ensure their rough terrain pallet jacks are easy and comfortable to use, even in the harshest conditions.</p>
<p>You can see how the project goes and determine if you need to add one to your fleet, or if you can simply rent one from time to time. With their 2.4 m long forks, these low level order pickers are able to pick up as many as three pallets weighing up to 2.5 t. These machines are replacing traditional forklifts and rough-terrain forklifts due to their increased versatility, safety and capacity; also, the ability to work better with delivery vehicles, lorries and containers.</p>
<p>Its key ability is that it can extend its forks beyond the compartment and reach into warehouse racks in a way that standard forklifts cannot. We offer proper service, timely response, reasonable pricing, proper control, and quality work. Electric forklifts are cheaper to operate as they cost less for fuel, require lower maintenance (having fewer moving parts), need less replacement of fluids and have considerably fewer lost hours from maintenance downtime and breakdown.</p>

It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds. As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
