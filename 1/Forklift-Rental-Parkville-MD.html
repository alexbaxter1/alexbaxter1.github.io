<p>This is the most common type of forklift driver, so once you have your licence you will be a highly employable candidate in the transport and logistics industry. Reliable Toyota Industrial engines offer faster acceleration and lift speeds, increasing productivity during stacking, loading and unloading goods, as well as horizontal transport functions.

<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
