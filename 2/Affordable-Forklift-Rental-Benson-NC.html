<p>The cost of renting a bucket truck will depend on the truck you're driving, the company, the working height, the geographical location and time you need it. The largest pricing factor, most of the time, will be the height limit. Most of the shipping firms now carry truck-mounted forklifts with them to easily off-load the construction products.

American Luxury Coach, a true grassroots family business, is a marketplace leader in using state-of-the-art technology in manufacturing custom trucks and SUVs, customizing them to be off-road ready. Ask how this Fleet breaks down between long-term rental units and short-term rental units.</p>

The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>Our fleet of forklifts are from well-known manufacturers like Komatsu, Genie, Toyota, and Lull. Having rust free suspension components when we go to install a lift, makes for a smooth transition from stock to lifted.
