Reach trucks come in multiple forms, including the Stand-Up truck and Double-Deep truck. We teach forklift operators. Lift Code 4: Turret Trucks. Providing a standup platform rather than a seat allows for the reach truck's shortened length giving it its "tight access" capability. We offer lifted trucks across a variety of models and trim levels, so no matter if you're shopping for a baseline full-size pickup or an upgraded heavy duty model, you can secure whichever you need with a lifted upgrade.</p>
<p>Forklift types vary in several aspects, from their fuel type and tire composition to their lift capacity and height. You'll need to raise your truck a lot and put on improved suspension components (shocks, springs, etc.) if you're thinking of really going off-road.
