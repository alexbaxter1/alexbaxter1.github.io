Reduced Downtime At Your Facility - During scheduled or emergency repairs our Rental and Service Departments can work together to provide you with trucks on rent to cover your shifts while your machines are in the shop.</p>
<p>Additionally, the larger tires of a lifted truck are designed to flex around obstacles like large rocks, which translates to more tire-to-ground contact for greater traction. It provides training as referred to in the laws relating to work equipment and health and safety, and is accredited by the Construction Plant Competence Scheme (CPCS). Each job is different, so we're dedicated to finding you the perfect rental forklift to match your needs, your personnel, and your timeline.</p>
