<p>When placed on the forks, the center of mass of the test weight should be located on the longitudinal centerline of the truck. Our electric Yale forklifts are perfect for improving uptime in any warehouse. For me, the back glass and top of my truck can be pretty difficult to reach by hand unless (even without a lift kit). Accelerate your distribution and reduce unnecessary handling time with electric powered order picking equipment.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits.

<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph C about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
