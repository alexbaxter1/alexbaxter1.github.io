Counterbalance forklift is characterized by its stability with the low center of gravity in its structure.

<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you.

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
