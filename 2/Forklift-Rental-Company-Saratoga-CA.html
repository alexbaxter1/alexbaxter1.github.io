If at any time a powered industrial truck is found to be in need of repair, defective, or in any way unsafe, the matter shall be reported immediately to the designated authority, and the truck shall be taken out of service until it has been restored to safe operating condition.</p>
<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend.
