<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>

Whether they be a factory-floor, rough terrain, or telehandler machine, forklifts often face far harder service than most farm machinery. Although a primitive pissing contest in the eyes of some, the lifted-truck community does get down and dirty in some sections; namely the mudder section.</p>
<p>Telescopic Handler forklifts are ideal for agriculture and anything that requires high lifting. Hand Pallet Trucks are equipped with quality materials, offering its high strength and durability.
