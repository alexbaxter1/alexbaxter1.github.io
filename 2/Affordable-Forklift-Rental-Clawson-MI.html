Rough terrain forklifts typically have rugged tyres and feature heavy-duty construction. For example, a hydraulic skate is not the same as a counterbalanced tricycle, although both are classified as forklifts.</p>
<p>116 Effective Powered Industrial Truck Operator Training Program Four major areas of concern must be addressed:  The general hazards that apply to the operation of all or most powered industrial trucks;  The hazards associated with the operation of particular types of trucks;  The hazards of workplaces generally; and,  The hazards of the particular workplace where the vehicle operates.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
