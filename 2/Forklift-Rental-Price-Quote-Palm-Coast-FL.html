<p>Our versatile Furniture Orderpickers enable you to equip your truck with the ideal fork length with extended baselegs for rail guidance application; select from varying fork lengths ranging from 42-96 inches.

There are different models of forklifts, and there are various forklift features that might not be the same with every model.</p>
