Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA.

Similar to a reach truck, the electric variety is only for indoor use.</p>
