New and used Reach Trucks are also available depending on the length of rental and budget. Suspension lift kits are best for drivers who are avid off-roaders because they give you additional ground clearance. Industrial counterbalance forklifts can be used in a wide range of applications, like agricultural, beverage distribution and bottling, and retail industries.</p>
<p>The global Pallet Trucks market is anticipated to represent a huge incremental opportunity between 2018 and 2028. This is achieved by two outer legs which distribute the load weight and prevent the forklift from tipping.
