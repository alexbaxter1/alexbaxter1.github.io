<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>We have a wide range of indoor and outdoor lift trucks. Powered pallet jacks: These jacks contain an electric motor which assists the user in lifting and moving heavier and even stacked pallets.
