<h2>Lifting & Material Handling Clintonville </h2>
<p>Licensing prerequisites are the same for both conventional and rough terrain forklifts. If at any time a powered industrial truck is found to be in need of repair, defective, or in any way unsafe, the matter shall be reported immediately to the designated authority, and the truck shall be taken out of service until it has been restored to safe operating condition.</p>

Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>TAWI Mobile Order Picker is compatible with any type of forklift or pallet jack and allows you to pick goods effortlessly with a vacuum lifter.

Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>
