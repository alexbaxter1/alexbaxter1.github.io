<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. The Pivot Steer Forklift Truck is commonly used in industry both inside of a warehouse and is ideal for very narrow aisle work as the mast can be rotated 90° to either side of the truck. It keeps some of the ride characteristics you love from the factory Jeep Wrangler spring while improving the off-road performance. We have an expansive inventory of pre-owned forklifts from Hyster, Taylor, Yale, Toyota, Caterpillar, Hoist, Kalmar, TCM and other leading brands.</p>
<p>While they move heavy loads and increase efficiency, forklifts can also cause serious injuries when they are used unsafely. Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision. OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.178 covering PITs requires employers to develop and implement a training program based on the general principles of safe truck operation.</p>

<p>In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually. Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>Electric forklift trucks provide higher efficiency than the other forklift trucks, and also the components of this machine offer optimal productivity to all its applications. These trucks are very efficient in transporting heavy to very heavy materials from one place to another. Our rentals have the flexibility for daily, weekly or monthly rentals and allow you flexibility in your material handling needs.</p>
<p>Guide rails, or electronic (or similar) guidance are suggested when lift trucks are operating in an area only used for stock pickers, side loaders, or order pickers.
