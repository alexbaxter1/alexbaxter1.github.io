The increased tire size and ground clearance makes off-roading increasingly possible by limiting the potential damage of debris, as well as providing an overall smoother ride across the rough ground.</p>
<p>There are also variants that features a stand-up forklift, which makes it easier for operators to hop on and off between loads.
