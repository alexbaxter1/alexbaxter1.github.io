<p>When you need power out of your forklifts, turn to Tynan for all the power you can handle.

<p>Easily movable sidegates allow operators to open the case-picking window, helping them to be more productive. Battery and charger included with rentals. If alternate capacities are shown for elevations lower than maximum, alternate capacities not shown may be 2 assumed to fall on a straight line between the capacity and the alternate capacities shown for each load center.</p>
<p>Motorized hand trucks must enter elevator or other confined areas with load end forward. There is a structure of movable parts which enable proper operating of the forklifts. The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily. The Hummer seems to be able to age well no matter how old it gets; and it also somehow avoids the Tonka toy look that sometimes befouls trucks when you try to put tires too large on them.</p>
