<p>The machine known as a stockpicker is an electric forklift truck specifically designed for filling individual customer orders which require piece-part or case picking, rather than full pallets or unit loads. Body lifts can increase the height of a truck by up to three inches and can allow for larger tires on the truck. A "lifted truck" is a truck whose suspension has been modified to accommodate larger tires, usually 35 inches or bigger.</p>
