Service brakes shall enable the truck to develop a drawbar drag equal to a percent of the gross vehicle weight (with rated capacity load) per the second column of the table on next page, while the truck is being towed slowly in either direction. From the wide-open operator window to its rock solid stability system, Crown's SP Series order pickers are designed to help busy order pickers maintain confidence at height and efficiently handle a variety of tasks.</p>
<p>However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses. Their manoeuvrability, tires and traction force make them very popular in industries where very heavy loads must be transported on rough or unpaved grounds.</p>

Most rental companies use Toyota forklift models due to their reputation for safety and performance.</p>
<h2>Truck With Lift Owings</h2>
<p>The standard lift kit raises your truck higher off the ground with affecting how it handles. Side Loader forklifts have been popular in the past as they were the first forklift designed specifically for long load handling. Unfortunately for those who want the Rocky Ridge bumpers on their Jeep but don't necessarily care about the rest of the lift kit, they are not available as a separate option.</p>
<p>At Thompson Machinery, we've invested in a fleet of Cat forklifts, so you don't have to. Simply let us know when you need your forklift and for how long. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see.

Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
<p>Over 100 forklifts ready to go for hire in all locations of the Melbourne and Geelong regions. That's right, this is the rough terrain forklift.
