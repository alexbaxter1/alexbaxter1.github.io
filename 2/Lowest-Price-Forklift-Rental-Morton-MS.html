<h2>Reach Fork Truck Morton</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>

<p>The majority of all rough terrain forklifts will have pneumatic tires since they are designed for traveling outdoors, such as on gravel or in yard work. TPC's video training on Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
<p>We have been providing Forklift sales and services since 1986. Do not pass under the raised portion of a forklift, regardless of the presence or absence of a load.

Finally, take the inspection to the road and see how the lifted truck performs on a bumpy terrain.
